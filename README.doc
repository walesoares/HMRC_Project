Notes
 I have been able to automate the following two test
 
•	Check you can sign up for a new account
•	Check you can create a new snippet

I have created the automation framework using page object model, as detailed below. The choice of is to allow easy understanding and good presentation of code.
1.	Created a Base package, and created a Driver class under it. This I use to tell my test which Webdriver driver, url page and browser to use. 

2.	Created to Page package and created the below pages as classes under the package. I created a constructor on each page to enable me call the methods in each page for my test.  For each class page, I created available web element objects using various locators and also declared their functions.  


•	Starting Page
•	Home Page
•	Signup Page
•	Sign up Landing page
•	Snippet page
•	Snippet Landing page

3.	Create a package called testcases, and TestRun as a class under this package.

  •	Extends the class to the Driver Class to inherit all the variable and methods
  •	Created object of each class in (no 2) and used that to call each method in the class 
  •	Used TESTNG annotation to determine which test should be run first and second 
  •	Used TESTNG assertion to confirm expected results of my test.
